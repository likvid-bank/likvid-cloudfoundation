    The **STACKIT Landing Zone** building block bootstraps a complete STACKIT sandbox platform
    integration inside a meshStack workspace. Running it once turns a STACKIT organization into a
    sandbox-ready self-service platform: it registers a meshStack location, carves out a dedicated
    STACKIT resourcemanager folder for the workspace and wires up the **STACKIT Project** platform
    together with its default landing zone.

    Optionally, when you provide a **network** configuration, it additionally layers on a
    hub-and-spoke network topology: a shared network-area address plan (the hub) and a self-service
    routed-network building block (the spoke) that application teams can order inside their own
    STACKIT projects.

    ## 🎯 When to use it

    Use this building block when you:
    - want to onboard STACKIT in meshStack without manually creating locations, folders and project platform wiring.
    - need a reusable setup for sandbox environments where application teams can request STACKIT projects self-service.
    - (optionally) want all tenant projects to draw from a single, non-overlapping IPv4 address plan
      and let application teams self-service order routed subnets — enable this by providing the
      **network** configuration.

    ## 💡 Usage examples

    **Example 1: Enable a new STACKIT sandbox platform**
    A platform engineer runs this building block once for a workspace to bootstrap the STACKIT location, landing-zone folder
    and default `STACKIT Project` platform so teams can start requesting projects immediately.

    **Example 2: Bootstrap with hub-and-spoke networking**
    A platform engineer provides a **network** configuration (CIDR plan, prefix bounds). In addition
    to the sandbox platform, the building block provisions the hub network area with the chosen
    address plan, registers the **STACKIT Network** building block, and adds a dedicated `networked`
    STACKIT Project building block definition plus landing zone whose projects are placed in the hub
    network area. Application teams can then self-service order routed spoke networks inside their projects.

    A **network** configuration looks like this (sensible example values shown — adapt them to your
    own address plan):

    ```json
    {
      "hub_network_area_name": "hub",
      "hub_network_ranges": ["10.0.0.0/16"],
      "hub_transfer_network": "10.1.255.0/24",
      "hub_min_prefix_length": 24,
      "hub_max_prefix_length": 28,
      "hub_default_prefix_length": 28,
      "hub_default_nameservers": [],
      "tenant_network_min_prefix_length": 24,
      "tenant_network_max_prefix_length": 28
    }
    ```

    ## 📦 Resources created

    - **meshStack location** – named after the chosen platform identifier.
    - **STACKIT resourcemanager folder** – created under the configured organization and owned by the given owner email.
      New tenant projects are created inside this folder.
    - **STACKIT foundation project** – created directly under the organization to host the
      project-creation service account and other landing-zone core assets.
    - **STACKIT Project platform** – the `STACKIT Project` building block definition, platform and default landing zone,
      including the project-creation service account provisioned in the foundation project.
    - **STACKIT Service Account building block** – the `STACKIT Service Account` building block
      definition (`TENANT_LEVEL`), so application teams can self-service create a service account
      with project roles and optional workload identity federation inside their own projects.
    - **Hub network area + spoke network building block + networked project definition and landing
      zone** *(only when a network configuration is provided)* – the shared hub address plan, the
      self-service `STACKIT Network` building block, and a second `STACKIT Networked Project`
      building block definition plus landing zone that places projects into the hub network area.

    ## 🧪 Playground mode

    **Playground Mode** is fixed by whoever deployed this definition and cannot be chosen when
    ordering. It defaults to `true`, which deploys a throwaway platform: the platform identifier gets
    a random suffix, and neither the landing-zone folder nor the foundation project is protected
    against deletion, so the whole thing can be deleted again in one step.

    The suffix matters because a platform identifier is unique across the whole meshStack instance
    and becomes part of every landing zone name under it. A playground deployment would otherwise
    occupy the plain name for good. Such a platform and the building block definitions it registers
    are meant for the deploying workspace only — do not publish them to other workspaces.

    A platform that is actually used is deployed from a definition with **Playground Mode** set to
    `false`. The identifier is then taken as given, and the folder and foundation project are guarded
    with `prevent_destroy`, so a deletion run fails rather than taking every tenant project with it.

    ## 🔑 Authentication

    You provide the STACKIT organization UUID, owner email, tags and default role mapping as inputs.
    The building block authenticates to STACKIT through workload identity federation, as a service account
    the platform team set up. No key is stored. The account needs `resource-manager.admin` on the organization.

    ## 📊 Shared responsibility

    | Responsibility | Platform Team | Application Team |
