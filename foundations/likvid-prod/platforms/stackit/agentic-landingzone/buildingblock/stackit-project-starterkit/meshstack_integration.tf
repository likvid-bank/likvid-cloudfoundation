    The **STACKIT Project Starterkit** gives your team a working STACKIT project through a single order. It creates a meshProject, places a STACKIT project tenant in the landing zone you select, and grants you the Project Admin role.

    ## 🎯 When to use it

    Order this building block when you:

    - Need a STACKIT project to build in and do not want to assemble the meshProject, the tenant and the access rights yourself.
    - Want the project governed from the start, with the tags and landing zone your platform team defined.

    ## 💡 Usage examples

    **Example 1: a project for a new service**
    A team starting a new service orders the starterkit with the name of the service and the `sandbox` landing zone. They get a meshProject, a STACKIT project inside it, and Project Admin on both.

    **Example 2: a routed project**
    A team that needs private connectivity picks a landing zone attached to a network area. Their STACKIT project is placed in that area and a routed subnet is created inside it in the same order — no second building block to request.

    ## What you get

    - A **meshProject** in your workspace, tagged as your platform team configured.
    - A **STACKIT project** in that meshProject, created by the landing zone's mandatory `STACKIT Project` building block.
    - A **routed network** inside the project, in landing zones attached to a network area, named after the project. The **Network** input controls its prefix length and nameservers; leaving it as it comes gives you a `/25`. Set it to `null` if you would rather have no network.
    - The **Project Admin** role for you, if you ordered this as a user rather than through an API key.

    You only see the **Network** input where at least one landing zone is attached to a network area. Picking a landing zone that is not attached to one gives you a project with no network, whatever the input says.

    One order creates one project. If you want separate development and production environments, order the starterkit twice.

    ## The starterkit removes itself when it is done

    Once everything above exists, this building block deletes itself, so you are not left with a block you cannot do anything further with. **Nothing it created is removed with it** — the meshProject, the STACKIT project and the network stay yours, and you manage them from then on. To get rid of them later, delete the meshProject.
