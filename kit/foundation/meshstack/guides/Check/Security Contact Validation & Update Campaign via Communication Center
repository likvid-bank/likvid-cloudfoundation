### 1. **Title**

Check/Update Security Contact

---

### 2. **Motivation / Business Context**

As part of its internal cloud governance model at **Likvid Bank**, every **application** running in the cloud must have a clearly defined **security contact**—an accountable individual responsible for security incidents, audit inquiries, and compliance communications.

Maintaining accurate contact information for each application ensures regulatory alignment (e.g., DORA, ISO 27001) and enables faster incident resolution across all cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).

---

### 3. **Challenges**

- Security contacts are outdated or entirely missing across many cloud-hosted **applications**.
- Development teams launching new **applications** were often unaware of the security metadata requirements.
- The central security team lacked visibility into which **applications** had valid contacts, increasing risk.
- Email communication and reminders were not effective and a lot of effort to send out
