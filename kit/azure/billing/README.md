# Azure Billing

Microsoft Cost Management is a suite of tools that help organizations monitor, allocate, and optimize the cost of their Microsoft Cloud workloads.

And, to DevOps teams managing resources in subscriptions and resource groups. Together, Cost Management and Billing are your gateway to the Microsoft Commerce system thatâ€™s available to everyone throughout the journey.
